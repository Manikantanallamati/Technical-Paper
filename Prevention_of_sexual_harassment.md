# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

## 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can happen when someone makes others feel uncomfortable through actions or words related to sex. This includes:

* Touching someone in a wrong or uncomfortable way

* Passing comments, jokes, or messages that are sexual in nature

* Sharing or showing pornographic content

* Staring or looking at someone in a creepy way

* Forcing or asking for sexual favours in exchange for work benefits

* Repeatedly asking someone out even after they say no

* Making the workplace feel unsafe or awkward because of such behaviour

## 2. What would you do if you face or see such behaviour?
If I face or see such behaviour happening to someone:

* I would report it to the PoSH Committee or the concerned person in the company

* I would try to write down what happened, including date, time, and people involved

* If Iâ€™m a witness, I would support the person and encourage them to speak up

* I will not ignore it, and I will make sure to keep it private and cooperate if there is an inquiry
