**Q3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?**

**Q8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**  
**A:** I want to read books every day. I will put the book on my bed (so I see it), read fun books, read just 2 pages, and give myself a small treat after reading.

**Q9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**  
**A:** I want to stop using my phone at night. I will put it in another friend's room in PG, use an alarm clock, and think about how I feel tired when I stay up late.
